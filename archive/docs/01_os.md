# 01 - Operating System

As page 00 says, we're using Ubuntu 22.04 for my nodes. This is because I wanted to handle everything myself and really understand what K8s needs in order to work.

## Emergency Access

Every system I use must have a user called `technat` that has a password in vault and optionally my public-key for SSH access.

Public Key: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIJov21J2pGxwKIhTNPHjEkDy90U8VJBMiAodc2svmnFC cardno:000618187880

### SSH config

If you configure SSH, you must set the following options:

- Port 59245
- PermitRootLogin no
- PasswordAuthentication no
- PubkeyAuthentication yes
- X11Forwarding no

## Firewall

Every system I use mustn't have a firewall configured. Remove all host-level firewalls and cloud-provider firewalls. We secure this later using cilium.

## Unattended-Upgrades

We want our kubernetes nodes to be up to date, so we enable automatic upgrades.

Paste the following content into `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades`:

```python
Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {
 "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}";
 "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-security";
 "${distro_id}ESMApps:${distro_codename}-apps-security";
 "${distro_id}ESM:${distro_codename}-infra-security";
 "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-updates";
 "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-proposed";
 "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-backports";
};

Unattended-Upgrade::DevRelease "auto";
Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies "true";
Unattended-Upgrade::SyslogEnable "true";
```

And enable the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now unattended-upgrades.service
```

## Kubernetes Prerequisites

The [kubeadm guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/) lists some prerequisites that a node must have:

- swap must be disabled
- static IP on the first interface (already given)
- containerd installed
  - on ubuntu we get it through the docker repo, there it's named `containerd.io`
- kubelet installed (using apt repos)
- `net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1` in sysctl
- `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` in sysctl
- `net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=1` in sysctl
- kernel module `overlay` loaded
- kernel module `br_netfilter` loaded
- all components must use the same cgroup, for me all shall use systemd and cgroup v2
  - for grub based systems this is `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="systemd.unified.cgroup_hierarchy=1"`
  - for containerd this is `SystemdCgroup = true`
- kubelet package on hold (not automatically upgraded)
- containerd package on hold (not automatically upgraded)

The following resources can be helpful to met those prerequisites:

- [install kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/)
- [my blog article about k8s kubeadm way](https://technat.ch/kubernetes/k8s_kubeadm/)

### kubelet flags

When the node is running on hcloud, add the following flag:

```bash
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/20-hcloud.conf
[Service]
Environment="KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=--cloud-provider=external"
EOF
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```

### Additional tools

Since the admin kubeconfig wonÂ´t leave the master node, we need some tools there to interact with the cluster:

- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)
- [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install)
